Done. Now run:

C:\Users\Priya>ls
'ls' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.

//What is the LS command in npm?
If you're not familiar with npm ls , it's a command available with the npm CLI that 
will list dependencies that have been installed to node_modules . Additionally,
it will return a non-zero exit code if the 
dependency tree that's resolved in node_modules is not what should be resolved from package.

Run in your command prompt----   C:\Users\Priya>cd first-react-app

Now we are going to run our project in Vs

///open vs code <open folder of first-react-app
//select all the file
//first react app get open
//close the outside terminal and now we are going to use vs code terminal

in vs code open new terminal
command: ls    // to check all the file is download

PS C:\Users\Priya\first-react-app> npm install
//packages get install. all the dependencies will find and install it. 

//if we do ls .  node_modules package  got install
PS C:\Users\Priya\first-react-app> ls

//now we do npm run dev -- the server will run  to launch dev server. now the server will run
PS C:\Users\Priya\first-react-app> npm run dev
