//node_modules-- these are dependencies. don't touch these node_modules. we are using react, so u will also
get react, dom packages

///public folder--- public/ Directory: Contains static files that don't 
change. index.html --file is also under public folder file.  images--which u show on home page, icon and favicon. 
this type thing genrally keep in public folder.

//src---actual source code. show vite has already created some source code like app.css, app.js, index.css, main.jsx
//src/ Directory: Main folder for the React code. In source directory you have all main react code.
    inside it genrally we will work with creating 3 folder
    1. Assets folder react all ready have created. we will keep our images, font, videos we will keep here.
        Images, fonts, and other static files.
    2. components/: we can create pages small components. then we can use it. so that components code we will
      keep here in coponents folder. Reusable parts of the UI, like buttons 
      or headers.
    3.styles/: CSS or stylesheets. keep in styles folder

eslintrc folder: lint will provide the information that you have write something wrong in the code, mistake, warning,
        suggestion. if you write something so give suggestion that write like this it will run fast. that tool is called
    lint. don't touch it default config hai

gitignore: these all will not check in git. gitignore have those files that we don't want that these are check in.

index.html:  first file that has basic code

//the most important file package.json
package.json:  contains information about this project like name, version, dependencies on other react 
packages. all the important information about project is keep here. from package.json -- u can directly change the name
of the file. your app name will change not folder name.
    two dependencies: react, react dom . latter will study on it

    devDependencies: kuch ase tools and libraries hai when we write code then we need. when our project is done
, we deploy on server, and on site then we don't need. these are those thing which help in write code.
devDependencies -- menas download karo but file you will give somenone your app. so don't need to add there.

vite.config.js---vite own config file. no specific write here. but you want to modify vite behaviour for that level
you can do here. 

package-lock.json:--- when you run npm intall. two things got created -- one is node_modules, 2nd is package-lock.json
 package-lock.json--tell you download the latest dependencies of react. it fill tell you what finally is used. genrally don't
check in here. if you have something gadbad or eroro. node_modules and package-lock ko delete kar again install it
npm intall kar ligiaye. then these will new will create
